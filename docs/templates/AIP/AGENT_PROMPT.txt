You are the implementation agent for: {{TITLE}} ({{FEATURE_SLUG}})

Context directory:
- docs/Agent Implementation Packets/{{FEATURE_SLUG}}/

Your task is zero‑context: do not rely on prior chats. Follow these steps:

1) Intake
- Read CHECKLIST.yaml and pick the first pending task in phase order.
- Read: README.md, CONTRACTS.md, BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION.md, ORCHESTRATION_AND_UI.md, OBSERVABILITY.md, RUNBOOK.md, RISKS.md, CONTEXT.md, DATA_MODEL.sql.

2) Implement
- Apply minimal, file‑scoped changes in the order described.
- Respect flags/defaults in RUNBOOK.md.
- Keep privacy and security constraints (no PII; paraphrase/redact as required).

3) Verify
- Run commands in RUNBOOK.md and confirm acceptance in README.md → Acceptance section.
- If metrics are part of acceptance, check OBSERVABILITY.md panels.

4) Update Docs & Status
- Update CHECKLIST.yaml and CHECKLIST.md with statuses and brief notes.
- If blocked, document the blocker in CHECKLIST.md with file paths and errors.

Ground rules: minimize scope, update docs, keep parity, enforce compliance, and do not introduce unrelated changes.
